    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Welcome to our website! We are a passionate team dedicated to creating an exciting and innovative Minecraft server network. Unlike other Minecraft networks, we strive for equality. At CubiGames, we believe that neither your proximity to the continental USA nor the version of Minecraft that you play should affect your playing experience. You can learn more about us and our mission at our about page.</p>

        <h3>Website Revamp!</h3>
        <p>We've completely revamped the website, leaving only the background colour and logo the same. Among the added features are a sticky navigation bar, a short summary of the longer About Us that hasn't been added yet, and this very News section.</p>
